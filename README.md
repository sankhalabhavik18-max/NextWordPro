# NextWordPro

NextWordPro is a **Next Word Prediction** project built in Python with a **Tkinter-based GUI**.  
It allows users to input a sequence of words and predicts the most likely next word using a trained language model.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Interactive GUI built with **Tkinter**  
- Predicts the next word for a given text input  
- Pre-trained tokenizer included (`tokenizer1.pkl`)  
- Training and evaluation notebooks available (`.ipynb`)  
- Multiple implementations (`predictions.py`, `predictions2.py`) for flexibility  

---

## ðŸ“Š Model Training
- **Dataset**: The model was trained on *metamorphosis_clean.txt*  
- **Training Details**:  
  - Trained for **150 epochs**  
  - Loss reduced from **7.87 â†’ 0.62**  
  - Framework: TensorFlow/Keras  

This demonstrates the modelâ€™s ability to learn meaningful language patterns for next-word prediction.
