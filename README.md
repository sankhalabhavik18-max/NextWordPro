# NextWordPro

NextWordPro is a **Next Word Prediction** project built in Python with a **Tkinter-based GUI**.  
It allows users to input a sequence of words and predicts the most likely next word using a trained language model.

---

## üöÄ Features
- **Interactive GUI** powered by Tkinter  
- Predicts the next word based on input text  
- Pre-trained tokenizer included (`tokenizer1.pkl`)  
- Training notebooks (`.ipynb`) for experimentation  
- Supports multiple implementations (`predictions.py`, `predictions2.py`)  

---

## üìä Model Training
- **Dataset**: (Add dataset details here, e.g. custom text corpus / Wikipedia subset / news articles)  
- **Training Details**:  
  - Model trained for **150 epochs**  
  - Loss reduced from **7.87 ‚Üí 0.62**  
  - Optimizer, learning rate, and architecture details can be added here  

This shows the model successfully learned meaningful next-word predictions.
